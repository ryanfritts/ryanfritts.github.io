## designs

A website, a postcard... a design is more than the words on the page. It needs to have a good feel. A good flow. All of the objects should work well together and look as if they belong, but too, there should be a sense of tension and interaction.
 
## illustrations
 
It's about the form and space as much as the line and shape. Hand drawing elements in a design evokes a stronger connection more grounded in reality. They are more primal. They hit us at our core.
 
## symbols
 
Whether it is logos, icons, or doodles, symbolic representations need to be concise, sparse, and imaginative. Letters and typography (or anything with a function) needs to be universal and innately recognizable in an instant.
