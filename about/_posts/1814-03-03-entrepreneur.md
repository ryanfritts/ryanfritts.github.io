## starting

I first started a commercial cleaning company. It was a great MBA program. I learned the basics of running a business. I had a wonderful time designing the website and marketing collateral, branding the company, and creating a strategic marketing plan. This lead to my next endeavor: a creative consulting firm.

## building
 
I worked as Managing Director for a non-profit theatre company, where we renovated and re-opened TGA, a defunct church, and built it into a new community arts and education center for South STL.  I coordinated events, booked talent, and facilitated the day-to-day.
 
## consulting
 
Throughout my freelance career, I have had the pleasure of working with new business owners and advising them on promotions, corporate identity, and general business guidance. I thrive in unstructured, chaotic environments. I am calm, candid, and decisive.
