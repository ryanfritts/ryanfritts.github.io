## talent

People need to spend their time doing what they do best. As the often cited quote goes "No one ever told the world class violinist that they were bad at golf". I find out where my people excel, and I put them to it. It's not a matter of if they do or don't want to do it... it's simply, who is the best person for the task.

## resource
 
I set my team up for success.  My main duty is to provide them with the tools they need to do the job quickly and effectively. Then, I to get out of their way. I am their steward. I run interference for them, and I knock down potential roadblocks. I make sure they are focused on what counts.
 
## leadership
 
I have exceptionally high standards for myself; thus, I have high standards for my team. Excellence is the watchword, not perfection. I am the paradigm for my people. I lead by example. I also, make mistakes... I accept them, learn from them, and move on - Making a deliberate effort for improvement.
