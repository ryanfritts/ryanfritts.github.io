## commercial

Powerful copy is more than just a catchy saying. Each word evokes it's own emotion. Each letter it's own percussion. They can be woven into a rhythmic beautiful tapestry. Your slogan is not just a bunch of words. It defines you. It is your singularity.

Poems and prose. Eccentric with a dash of whimsy. My creative writing carries on from the bards of old.  Storytelling has fallen out of fancy and is slowly becoming a lost art, but the straw house collapses without the narrative.
