## backpacking

Preparation is key in exploration. Expect the best, but plan for the worst. I go into the woods "because I [wish] to live deliberately"... to learn and live.  A retreat from the exacerbated pace of the world. A calming of my thoughts. A recharging of my spirit.
 
## mini-adventures
 
My wife and I set out each week on mini-adventures. We become tourists in our own town. We experience the world fresh and try new things. Museums, food fairs, and walks in the park. A tiny feat a week gives us joyous memories to keep.
 
## life
 
The biggest adventure of all. Each day, I start fresh. I accept and learn from old failures; I seek out and take on new challenges; and I strive to reach and exceed my goals.
