		<h2>designs</h2>
		<p>A website, a postcard... a design is more than the words on the page.  It needs to have a good feel. A good flow. All of the objects should work well together and look as if they belong, but too, there should be a sense of tension and interaction.</p>
		
		</section>
		
		<section class="secondary">
		<h2>illustrations</h2>
		<p>It's about the form and space as much as the line and shape. Hand drawing elements in a design evokes a stronger connection more grounded in reality.  They are more primal.  They hit us at our core.</p>
	
		</section>
		
		<section class="tertiary">
		<h2>symbols</h2>
		<p>Whether it is logos, icons, or doodles, symbolic representations need to be concise, sparse, and imaginative. Letters and typography (or anything with a function) needs to be universal and innately recognizable in an instant. </p>

		<h2>html5</h2>
		<p>Having semantic markup makes for better content that people can read. An added bonus is that search engines love it too, and they can index the site more effectively bringing much higher rankings.</p>

		<h2>css3</h2>
		<p>If looks could sell... CSS3 is your new super agent with all the fancy gadgets and tricks.  But as fun as all the bells and whistles are, you don't want them to fizzle out.  Not all modules are created equally; not all get adopted across the board; and the overall brand must always be paramount.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="tertiary">
		<h2>robust CMS</h2>
		<p>For any expansive website with a large amount of information, Content Management Systems are a must. Wordpress has become a powerhouse. It is easy to theme and customize, and it is super easy for the users to add content through the admin page. Drupal is rising in the ranks and soon it will be dominant due to it's extensibility.  </p>

		<h2>starting</h2>
		<p>I first started a commercial cleaning company. It was a great MBA program. I learned the basics of running a business. I had a wonderful time designing the website and marketing collateral, branding the company, and creating a strategic marketing plan. This lead to my next endeavor: a creative consulting firm. </p>

		<section class="secondary">
		<h2>building</h2>
		<p>I worked as Managing Director for a non-profit theatre company, where we renovated and re-opened TGA, a defunct church, and built it into a new community arts and education center for South STL.  I coordinated events, booked talent, and facilitated the day-to-day.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="tertiary">
		<h2>consulting</h2>
		<p>Throughout my freelance career, I have had the pleasure of working with new business owners and advising them on promotions, corporate identity, and general business guidance. I thrive in unstructured, chaotic environments. I am calm, candid, and decisive.</p>

		<h2>talent</h2>
		<p>People need to spend their time doing what they do best. As the often cited quote goes "No one ever told the world class violinist that they were bad at golf". I find out where my people excel, and I put them to it. It's not a matter of if they do or don't want to do it... it's simply, who is the best person for the task.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="secondary">
		<h2>resource</h2>
		<p>I set my team up for success.  My main duty is to provide them with the tools they need to do the job quickly and effectively. Then, I to get out of their way. I am their steward. I run interference for them, and I knock down potential roadblocks. I make sure they are focused on what counts. </p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="tertiary">
		<h2>leadership</h2>
		<p>I have exceptionally high standards for myself; thus, I have high standards for my team. Excellence is the watchword, not perfection. I am the paradigm for my people. I lead by example. I also, make mistakes... I accept them, learn from them, and move on - Making a deliberate effort for improvement. </p>

		<h2>commercial</h2>
		<p>Powerful copy is more than just a catchy saying. Each word evokes it's own emotion. Each letter it's own percussion. They can be woven into a rhythmic beautiful tapestry. Your slogan is not just a bunch of words. It defines you. It is your singularity.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="secondary">
		<h2>blogs</h2>
		<p>Blogs are essays. They can be quick chunks of information to keep us up to date, or they can be more detailed arguments to persuade us how to think and reason.  Blogs have broken the barrier; the ideas and content now speak for themselves.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="tertiary">
		<h2>creative</h2>
		<p>Poems and prose. Eccentric with a dash of whimsy. My creative writing carries on from the bards of old.  Storytelling has fallen out of fancy and is slowly becoming a lost art, but the straw house collapses without the narrative.</p>

		<h2>backpacking</h2>
		<p>Preparation is key in exploration. Expect the best, but plan for the worst. I go into the woods "because I [wish] to live deliberately"... to learn and live.  A retreat from the exacerbated pace of the world. A calming of my thoughts. A recharging of my spirit.</p>
